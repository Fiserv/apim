# Rateplan Management

When a developer wants to consume a monetized API, they will need to subscribe to a suitable plan that meets their business requirements in terms of capacity and pricing. The developer portal will provide detailed information about the available plans, allowing them to evaluate and choose the most appropriate one. There are two types of plans: prepaid and postpaid. With prepaid plans, the developer needs to make an upfront payment to add credits to their balance, which will be deducted based on the number of API calls made. In the case of postpaid plans, the developer will receive an invoice at the end of the billing cycle for the services they have used.

Begin the integration using the following services in the Rateplan Management in API Explorer:
* [Create Rateplan](?path=reference/ConsumerManagement/CreatesRateplan)
*  [List of Rateplan](?path=reference/ConsumerManagement/listRateplan)
*  [Get Rateplan](?path=reference/ConsumerManagement/GetRateplan)
*  [Update Rateplan](?path=reference/ConsumerManagement/Rateplan)
